In order to follow the best practices, the summary should be between 39 and 70 characters. The recommended summary is: 'Sourcetree crashes upon opening repeatedly.' \" \n\n### Example 2 ###\n\"input\": {{'Summary':'Opening and closing Sourcetree causes Pageant to crash\\/close',\n'Description':'I have installed putty and pageant outside of Sourcetree, and I have Pageant startup during OS boot so my key-file is always ready.\r\n\r\nDidn't quite notice it at first, so not sure which version it started at, but Sourcetree now causes Pageant to crash\\/close when it opens or closes, causing e.g. git commands and such from command line to suddenly start to failing for no apparent reason.\r\n\r\nWhenever I open or close Sourcetree now, I have to reopen Pageant and reload my key, including entering a long passkey. Super annoying. Sourcetree shouldn't close or cause any other applications to crash when it opens or when it closes.\r\n\r\nIt happens on all 3 computers of mine. All running latest Windows, latest Pageant, and latest Sourcetree.',\n'VersionsAffected':'3.4.4',\n'IssueType':'Bug',\n'Project':'Sourcetree for Windows',\n'Components':'General'}},\n\"output\": \"The summary has 61 characters, which is within the best practice range.
