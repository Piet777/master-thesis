    "template": "'Bug Report Structure':\nThe description field is important for the bug report, as it describes the issue in detail.\n\n### Description Components ###\nThe description of a bug report should contain the following important components:\nOverview: A description of the context/problem, a summary, te requirement, or a problem statement. This is usual the beginning of the description. Keywords for overview heading are: overview, summary, description, problem;\nSteps to reproduce: A list of steps to reproduce, or the scenario to produce the error. Keywords for steps to reproduce heading are: steps, reproduce, scenario, how to;\nActual result: The result that is currently produced, the actual behaviour, or what actual happens. Keywords for actual result heading are: actual, result, behaviour, happens;\nExpected result: The result that was expected, the expected behaviour, or what should happen. Keywords for expected result heading are: expected, result, behaviour, should.\n\nAdditionally, the description could contain the following components:\nStack Traces: A list of relevant stack traces for the bug report.\nBuild date and hardware: The build date and hardware, as well as when and where the bug occurred.\nAdditional information: Additional information relevant to the bug report, including screenshots, videos, or other files.\n\n### Task ###\nWe want to determine the degree of completeness of the original/old description based on the provided context of the description field.\nThe important components of a description are an overview, steps to reproduce, the actual result and the expected result.\nWe define a clear structure when we have appropriate headings for each important component in the description, except for the overview component.\nEven if the overview component does not have a heading, but can be assumed as overview it is considered to be present and complete.\nThe degree is between 1 and 3:\n1: The original/old description contains all important components or has only been rearranged.\n2: The original/old description contains a minimum of 2 components but is not complete.\n3: The original/old description is a plain text without a clear structure.\n\nIf the description field is missing some important parts, we want to rearrange the description field accordingly.\nReturn the degree of completeness, the revised description, and a short two-sentence explanation for the changes made.\n\nThe bug report is in JSON format.\n{examples}",
