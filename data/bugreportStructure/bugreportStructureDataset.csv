Hyperledger,42808,1,Chaincode Init function is executing even after instantiation via Invoke method,"I am using high level fabric-contract-api for writing chaincode. I defined Init method with some predefined key values to include in Ledger while instantiating. However this Init method is executing with invoke command 

 

To instantiate the chaincode, I use the following command:
 ``` 

peer chaincode instantiate -o orderer.example.com:7050 -C mychannel -n blue-coin -l ""$CC_RUNTIME_LANGUAGE"" -v 1.0 -c '

{""Args"":[""init""]}

' -P ""OR ('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')""

{{```}}
 The {{Args}} property needs to specify the name of the method (i.e., which is {{init}}) so that it will be called during instantiation.

I initially thought that the {{init}} method can be called only during instantiation since the {{init}} method may contain code that will initialize some values in the world state (e.g., set values to zero).

However, I realized that the same {{init}} method can be called beyond initialization by calling the invoke command:
 ```

 {{peer chaincode invoke -o orderer.example.com:7050 -C mychannel -n blue-coin -c '\{""function"":""init"",""Args"":[]}'}}

```
 If a user can execute the {{init}} command beyond initialization, there is a risk that the values in the world state will be reinitialized to its initial value.",,Bug,Fabric,,2019-10-18 06:47:00,2019-12-20 12:28:36,Unverified,Medium,Tech Now,Tech Now,,,external,,,,"Empty DataFrame

Hyperledger,43412,3,PING/PONG frames handling in Websocket services is not implemented,"*Summary:*
 Websocket RFC [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-5.5.2] indicates that services have to support PING frame requests and answer a PONG.

*What happens:*
 When websocket client connected to Besu sends PING frames, Besu is not able to understand them and answers an invalid request message.

*What should happen:*
 When websocket client connected to Besu sends PING frames, Besu should answer with a PONG frame as indicated in the RFC.

*How to reproduce:*
 The easy way is to use Web3j with a websocket connection. Indeed Web3j uses [Java-websocket library|https://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket] that automatically prevents  connection loss by sending a ping frame, by default every minute.
 1 - run a Besu node with websocket api enabled and reachable.
 2 - create a websocket connection and send a PING frame as indicated in the RFC. Here is attached [^ping_frame_bug_demo.zip]with a very simple project to demo this. Just adapt the url in the Main.java to your running node and run `./gradlew run` in the project root.",Besu 1.3,Bug,Besu,,2019-11-21 15:26:13,2019-11-22 00:31:44,To Do,Medium,Nicolas MASSART,Nicolas MASSART,,,,,,,"Empty DataFrame

JFrog,50425,0,Unable to download NLog newer than 4.4.6 from proxy repo,"*Steps to reproduce:*
* Setup remote repository in Artifactory to nuget.org
* Create empty C# project in Visual Studio 2017
* Open window ""Package Manager Console"" ([see Microsoft docs|https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/tools/package-manager-console])
* Execute line ""Find Package -Id NLog -Source ""http://...."""", where http address should be from first item (e.g. to remote nuget repo)
* Remember package list
* Go to official nuget site to see available packages https://www.nuget.org/packages/NLog/4.4.12

*Expected result:*
MSVS shows the same last packages with nuget web site , both of them are 4.4.12

*Actual result:*
Local Artifactory has the last nuget package version - 4.4.6
Nuget.org web side has the last nuget package version - 4.4.12

*Possible issue:*
Nuget Api v2 returns 100 packages per single request. So, NLog package with version 4.4.6 is the 100th version of this package. You can check url https://your-artifactory/api/nuget/nuget.org-proxy/FindPackagesById()?id=%27NLog%27&$skip=100 and https://your-artifactory/api/nuget/nuget.org-proxy/FindPackagesById()?id=%27NLog%27&$skip=1 (see the last number of this URL)

Therefore, possible, Artifactory does not do deep lookup of the package and can return only 100 versions of package.

Qt,164709,0,ui_mainwindow.h rebuilt  ,"Hello, 

I have noticed the ui_mainwindow.h doesn't get automatically generated. I noticed this well working on a small program which I had check into mercurial. Initially, I checked in ui_mainwindow.h.  Since it is generated via uic.exe, I removed it from the repository. 

When I check the code out, the build failed because it didn't know how to regenerate the file. 

The obvious workaround is:

Save NodeA in NodaARepository, save NodeB in NodeBRepository and all Associations in AssociationRepository
