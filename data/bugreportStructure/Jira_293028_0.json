        "Description":"Running 'stree' without any parameters from the terminal does two things. Firstly it opens a new instance of SourceTree even if one's running. Secondly it assumes the current path is the repository to open.\r\n\r\nTake a look into making SourceTree just open if it isn't already and not opening any bookmarks etc.",
