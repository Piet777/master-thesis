        "Description":"I have a page with several fields and some of them are required (required attribute is set to true). If this page is not invlolved in a flow, and if I don't fill in one of the required fields, after submitting, I get back to my page and all the fields I previously filled in are still there. I can correct the missing fields. So it's OK.\n\nSame sample within a flow (I mean a flow is already started when I get to this page): if I don't fill all of the required fields or if I fill in a field which doesn't meet its validator, all of the fields are emptied after getting back to the page (because of validation problem).",
