        "Description":"If the player opens their inventory quickly after respawning in a world with 'Immediate Respawn' enabled, the world will crash. This happened accidentally once in one of my worlds. I tried it a few more times after reloading, and it seemed to happen reliably as long as I opened my inventory at the right time.",
