        "Description":"As the next part of implementing change streams, we need to define a {{ChangeStreamGetMore}} struct that implements {{Operation}}. This operation should wrap the {{GetMore}} operation, calling {{Aggregate::build}} and {{Aggregate::handle_response}} in its own respective {{build}} and {{handle_response}} methods.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the {{poll_next}} methods on the {{ChangeStream}}'s {{Stream}} implementation should be updated to create and execute a {{ChangeStreamGetMore}} operation, following the pattern used in the {{Cursor}}'s {{poll_next}} implementation.",
