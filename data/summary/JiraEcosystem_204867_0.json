        "Summary":"Single Select control will flow up and off screen instead of just expanding the size and expanding below",
        "Description":"If the Single Select control is used near the top of a page and there isn't enough room at the bottom for it to expand, the control will expand above instead of below and can be unusable.\r\n\r\nAfter some digging I noticed that it may be an issue with the tether constraint to: 'window'. Using to: 'scrollParent' provides the desired functionality where the control will expand below and allow users to scroll down.",
