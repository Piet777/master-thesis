        "Description":"System export with an admin user that has a changed password (not default 'password')\nMove DB to fresh Oracle from Derby.\nStart up server, starts up successfully\nTry to log in with admin you see the error message: \"Too many failed attempts, try again in 1 seconds\"\nThis is because there is a proxy server that is doing authenticated health pings using the admin credentials from the previous system\n\nWorkaround: Turn off the proxy server during migration, or do an artifactory.conig.import.xml security.import.xml procedure to get login credentials set.\n\nChange request: make it so system pings do not add to the authentication failure count",
