Jira,151397,0,Show the login screen when user attempts to create an issue and is not logged in,"When a potential user clicks on a link to create an issue and is not logged in, they see the following message:

Why doesn't this page just show a login required screen like /browse/[PROJECT] does? Or better yet, show the actual login with the os_destination set?

Qt,187366,0,looks like a bug: can never load qt jpeg plugin on windows mobile 6 ,"
QDir(path).entryList(QDir::Files) always returns empty string list on windows mobile 6,
which leads to failure of loading qt plugins .

I fixed it by enclosing these lines in #ifndef Q_OS_WINCE preprocessor directives.

qfilesystemiterator_win.cpp Ln#97 - Ln#100
------------------------------------------------------
if (QSysInfo::windowsVersion() >= QSysInfo::WV_WINDOWS7) {
            dwAdditionalFlags = 2;  // FIND_FIRST_EX_LARGE_FETCH
            infoLevel = 1 ;         // FindExInfoBasic;
}
------------------------------------------------------
these above lines will fail the following call on wince 6,

findFileHandle = FindFirstFileEx((const wchar_t *)nativePath.utf16(), FINDEX_INFO_LEVELS(infoLevel), &findData,
                                         FINDEX_SEARCH_OPS(searchOps), 0, dwAdditionalFlags);

according to MSDN, dwAdditionalFlags=2 is not supported on wince6, and findFileHandle will always get a INVALID_FILE_HANDLE.

Spring,10984,0,o.s.web.util.Log4jConfigListener - able to load log4j config file from file system,"My use case requries me to have my log4j.properties located on a AS/400 server and Tomcat running on a Win2003 box. 

Tomcat must be able to use the log4j.properties located on the AS/400 file system.

I am using Spring to setup log4j in web.xml such as:

	<listener>
		<listener-class>org.springframework.web.util.Log4jConfigListener</listener-class>
	</listener>

	<context-param>
		<param-name>log4jRefreshInterval</param-name>
		<param-value>60000</param-value> <!-- 1 min -->
	</context-param>

	<context-param>
		<param-name>log4jConfigLocation</param-name>
		<param-value>/WEB-INF/log4j.properties</param-value>
	</context-param>

In Spring 1.1.3 it is not possible to specify the location of log4j.properties outside the web application archive. Okay yes it is possible if you do not have the defined log4jConfigLocation in the web.xml file then it would default to locate the log4j.properties in the classpath.

I do not want to alter the CLASSPATH of TOMCAT or whatever web container we are using. I want to be able to specify the location of the log4j.properties file in the web.xml file. So I modified the Log4jWebConfigurer to be able to do this. Now I can set the location of the log4j.properties in web.xml such as:

	<context-param>
		<param-name>log4jConfigLocation</param-name>
		<param-value>file:/C:/mylog4j.properties</param-value>
	</context-param>


And it would get the file from the file system. I am using Springs own code to locate the file (PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver).

I failed to make SF CVS work so I downloaded the nightly snapshot and modified the java file.

I have attached my modified java file to this JIRA.

Spring,33370,0,Remove spring-tx dependency from MessagingTemplate,"We have several ways of starting the MessageFlow

1. gateway
2. channel.send(message)
3. message-publisher
4. inbound-adapter
5. scheduler
6. poller

1, 2 and 3 involves 3rd party to initiate the flow. Such 3rd party can begin transaction before exercising any of the scenarios. So TX configuration could be easily done in Spring the conventional way (annotation Gateway interface with @Transactional) and the Thread would propagate the TX context until thread boundary breaks. The main thing is that all 3 of them expect TX to exist before they are initiated. 

4, 5 and 6 does not involve human to initiate the flow, so it make sense to expose TX configuration (e.g., the same way we do it in poller now).

_MessagingTemplate_ is really a helper class used by all of the above scenarios and based on the scenario transactional context might or might not exist. But in any event _MessagingTemplate_ should not directly depend on spring-tx API.

Whenever I tame cats from another village and bring them home with me, they never want to stay. When I make them sit, they tend to scoot around literally everywhere until they can get out of my house and flee back to their village. If I go around the village, the cat will teleport to me, ignore me, and run back. My friend's that I play with on IOS have never had this problem on their worlds, and it is quite frustrating.

JiraEcosystem,56595,0,Allow bulk update of multiple rows with a single statement,"If you need to update multiple entities at once, you need to do it like this at the moment:

{code}
Query myQuery = Query.select().where(""firstColumn = ?"", firstValue);

for (MyEntity myEntity : myEntities) {
    myEntity.setSecondColumn(secondValue);
    myEntity.save();

This results in lots of the following SQL statements:
{code}
UPDATE myEntity
SET secondColumn = ""secondValue""
WHERE ID = x

For every single entity that needs to be updated.

This could be improved with something like this (just my suggestion, not sure whether this is possible):

{code}
Query myQuery = Query.select().where(""firstColumn = ?"", firstValue);
ao.update(MyEntity.class, myQuery, ""secondColumn"", ""secondValue"");
{code}

At the end, the following statement should be executed:

{code}

Hyperledger,31303,0,Possible issue where another org is unable to instantiate a chaincode container easily when using node.js chaincode ,"The problem here is around the fact that different organisations could require slightly different chaincode packages when using node.js because they could have different network requirements in order to build the chaincode container image which is done running npm install --production.

For example org1 may have no requirements so do not need to include a '.npmrc' file in the chaincode package. org2 however are a using a proxy so need to set the proxy information in the .npmrc and include it in the chaincode package.

From experimentation, I found the following
 - If both orgs have the chaincode installed then instantiation or upgrade will build the chaincode containers for both without issue
 - If however, org2 did not have the chaincode installed at instantiation/upgrade time, and add the chaincode package later. The chaincode container image will not be built and the following error is received

{noformat}
Error: 2 UNKNOWN: error executing chaincode: could not get ChaincodeDeploymentSpec for basic-sample-network:0.2.4: get ChaincodeDeploymentSpec for basic-sample-network/mychannel from LSCC error: chaincode fingerprint mismatch data mismatch
{noformat}

Currently there is no way to ""pre-vendor"" the necessary node_modules that would make up a complete chaincode package client side due to 2 issues
1. The node-sdk packager explicitly ignores the node_modules directory
2. A solution to native modules would be required as the target platform may not match the client platform

This implies that it should be possible to include or be able to provide npm configuration information that is either not part of the package or not included in the fingerprint of the package to allow for this situation.
It looks like it might be possible to use the upgrade mechanism as a workaround

I am not familiar with the fingerprint mechanism and based this Jira on some simple experiments so I may also be missing other scenarios where problems could occur.
