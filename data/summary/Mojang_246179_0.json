        "Description":"[^Minecraft_2019-06-15-21-42-23_1.mp4]\n\nHopefully that link works, I'm doing all of this on my phone. Ever since 1.14 came out, I redownloaded minecraft on my Android S8 and have been playing it nonstop. Whenever I tame cats from another village and bring them home with me, they never want to stay. When I make them sit, they tend to scoot around literally everywhere until they can get out of my house and flee back to their village. If I go around the village, the cat will teleport to me, ignore me, and run back. My friend's that I play with on IOS have never had this problem on their worlds, and it is quite frustrating. I can never tame cats from villages, I can only spawn them in if I don't want to run into this problem.\u00a0",
