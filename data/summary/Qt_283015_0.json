        "Description":"I cannot provide the whole project (it is big and not open source), but on Windows the code completion completely fails in a larger cmake project. \r\n\r\nNothing happens in any of the files even in basic classes. It also does not work if the code is plainly written in the top of a file.\r\n !image-2019-08-22-10-55-08-353.png|thumbnail! \r\n !image-2019-08-22-10-57-37-067.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nThe code completes on Mac. It may be a settings issue, but removing the QtCreator ini-file didn't help. (I have not tried to remove settings on Mac).\r\n\r\n",
