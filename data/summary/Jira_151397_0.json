        "Summary":"Show the login screen when user attempts to create an issue and is not logged in",
        "Description":"When a potential user clicks on a link to create an issue and is not logged in, they see the following message:\r\n\r\nErrors\r\n\r\nYou are not logged in, and do not have the permissions required to create an issue in this project as a guest.Test\r\n\r\nTo create an issue first log in\r\n\r\nAnd the `log in` text is a link (but not underlined as links usually are).\r\n\r\nWhy doesn't this page just show a login required screen like \/browse\/[PROJECT] does? Or better yet, show the actual login with the os_destination set?\r\n\r\nWe've had some folks who misinterpret the error notice and think they can't create an issue, which then leads to unusual emails and error reports and sometimes angry\/baffled users. All because the message is telling them something they don't understand. Why not just do the login redirect for them?",
