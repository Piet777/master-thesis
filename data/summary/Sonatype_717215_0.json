        "Summary":"Create CircleCI ORB that uses maven-release-plugin to do releases",
        "Description":"The ORB we use now has a number of drawbacks, and is confusing about the development version is use after a release (no indication of dev SNAPSHOT, etc).\r\n\r\nRather than trying to re-invent the maven release process, instead see if we can create an ORB that invokes the m-release-p to do releases. Doing so will provide standard \"maven style\" SNAPSHOT versions for development, while using \"release\" versions for releases.",
