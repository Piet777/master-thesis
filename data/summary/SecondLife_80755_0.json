        "Description":"When merging the changes for OPEN-50, I found that I wanted to be able to use the --dry-run option to see what system commands would be executed for the configure and build sub-commands on each of the platforms.  At present, the platform used is always the real local platform, but I wanted to be able to override that so that I could see how a configuration change would affect the system commands used on a different platform.",
