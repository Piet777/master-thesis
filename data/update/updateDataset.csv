JFrog,78527,3,ECDSA and ED25519 keys not supported for SSH authentication,"ECDSA and ED25519 keys are not supported for SSH authentications but in the UI it shows these keys to be supported. RSA key works as expected but other keys fail. This behaviour was reproduced by using the JFrog CLI.

The steps to reproduce:
 # Generate the keys using the ECDSA and ED25519 algorithm.
 # Add public key under Profile --> SSH (adding ECDSA and ED25519 keys doesn't throw any error)
 # Link these keys to the JFrog CLI

Jira,364556,33,Can't Resolve Using Mine,"I merged a branch into my current branch, and had a number of merge conflicts.  I want to resolve a heap of them by selecting them and right click and select Resolve Conflicts/Resolve Using 'Mine' option.
I get the normal confirmation prompt and when I press OK I get an error message saying: 
""Could not update one or more files, please check that no other application is locking your files.""
Restarted my PC and opened on Source Tree and tried again, and still get the same error.  These are just html files, that are not being used by anything.

How can I resolved this and get on with my merge so I can use my working environment again?

This proves that nothing else is using them.  Also I downloaded MS Process Explorer and it also tells me that nothing has locked the files.\r\n\r\nI really need this fixed so I can get on with my work... at the moment my source is in a big mess with 75 conflicts that I can't resolve!!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nScott

I'm lost!

If you look at the /.git/ folder is there a file called 'index.lock'? In my case there was a index.lock file which when deleted and SourceTree restarted everything went back to normal. Hope this helps. \r\n\r\nPritesh

5          I'm facing this issue as well and this workaround cannot be applied, because i have no index.lock file in .git folder.\r\nMaybe it will help if I tell that in the beginning I had conflict because I made change to that file in another branch and in current branch I have deleted it. \r\nSo I've right clicked the file and choose merge using external tool (i have TortoiseMerge installed), but it never opened. Then I just tried to use ""resolve using mine"" and it failed with error mentioned above.\r\n\r\nFortunately for me resolving conflict was about deleting conflicting files, so I've deleted them manually on disk then clicked checkboxes in SourceTree to mark them as staged in commit view. They then just disappeared from view and I can do my commit now.

I also made a merge from another branch and in the other branch the file with the issue had been deleted. \r\n\r\nSo to solve it I just deleted the file in my branch.\r\n\r\nIt does seem like a bug with version 1.6.11.0. though I upgraded this morning and I have never seen this before.

8                                  We have had several users have this problem with the newest version of SourceTree in windows (currently 1.6.12.0). Deleting the index.lock file does not help. At least one of these users saw the problem because the remote branch to be merged in had a deleted file which was edited in the current branch. It is like SourceTree does not understand how to resolve this type of merge. Merging via the command line gives you the options to remove the file, or keep the edits of the current branch.\r\n\r\nIn this situation, the resolution would be to allow the same options: To delete the file, or keep the current branch's edits. In many cases, it would be a manual hybrid of the two, but there needs to be some handling of this situation.

Where it is located?\r\nWhere I can find the logs of SourceTree, to attach here? Folder {{%LOCALAPPDATA%\Atlassian\SourceTree}} only contains a {{sourcetree.log}} but it is too old.

I pulled the remote branch and I cannot resolve the conflects. Did you find a solution?  
19                                Hi all,\r\n\r\nI had a same problem (""Could not update one or more files, please check that no other application is locking your files."") after pulling a branch from remote.\r\n\r\nI have opened task manager in windows just to check which process is using files in the same time. And I discovered it is Git. I have i5 procesor, 3 core were using 100% and they are just filing up RAM memory. It takes some time, but if you let it finish, you can resolve with ""mine"" or ""their"" with no problem (it takes more or less 1 min - if it moves, just give it more time :P ).\r\n\r\nApparently, it hapened because pull was a really big so git have a lot of files to check so it is kinda slow.\r\n\r\nCan anybody check this, and confirm my opinion?

23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Same, also resolving using ""Theirs"".\r\n\r\nI've had to deal with merge conflicts quite a bit and this has never happened before. What's special about this particular merge conflict is that the same file is deleted by one person and it's added back by another person through another branch, so I think maybe that's what's confused SourceTree. Hopefully this information helps with resolving the bug.

But in my case cant resolve with 'Theirs'\r\nI've run process-explorer (in admin-mode). And searched for the file name. No process has the file open at all .\r\nBother!\r\n\r\nI've tried re-starting source tree. No luck.\r\nBother.

This is a SourceTree state bug.\r\n\r\nI was able to make my edits outside of SourceTree, then mark it as resolved. This issue should be moved to High Priority.\r\n\r\nSteps that lead to this (I don't know the cause):\r\n* Right click conflicted file -> Resolve conflicts -> Launch external merge tool (p4merge)\r\n*  p4merge does not open.\r\nAny further attempts to open result in this error message. There is no file lock on the file (confirmed) and no p4merge or git procces are running. Restarting SourceTree does not fix the error.\r\n\r\nEnvironment: Windows 10\r\nVersion: SourceTree 1.9.6.1  ",True,Priority has to be set from 'Medium' to 'High'.
Jira,279082,1,Tickets missing,"I got an issue that I am not sure why it is happening.

After I have created a new project to be accessible by an individual Client, some how I got some of the existing tickets missing. Nobody has removed the ticket ( at least I could not see anywhere the ticket was removed.). This is the message when I try to open the ticket:
Permission Violation

If it helps, this is the direct URL of the ticket:
https://infobahn.jira.com/browse/LDG-1753

I got a few other tickets missing...
Can you help me on finding the reason/solution for the missing ticket?

On Instances in which the base name starts with wiki (*wikitest.atlassian.net*, for example) the Recently Updated Macro and the Recently Updated dashboard are not working properly. The macros load the pages properly, however the link to the pages are broken, with the base URL duplicated, for example:

 # Create an Instance which its name starts with wiki (i.e. *wikisomething*)
 # Create a page.
 # Add the Recently Updated Macro on it.
 # Publish the page.
 # Click on a link from the macro (make sure to have updated some pages recently).

h3. Expected Results

The links should work properly.

Jira,1742812,1,Setting a landing product will not redirect customers to the portal,"h3. Issue Summary

By default, when customers with an Atlassian account (with no product access, just active on the site) access the site's URL (https://example.atlassian.net), they will be redirected to the portal URL so they can authenticate and access the portal.

However, when a [landing product is configured|https://support.atlassian.com/organization-administration/docs/set-your-sites-landing-product/], these customer accounts will face a message stating that they do not have access to the product on the site instead of being redirected to the portal.

h3. Steps to Reproduce
# Configure at least, a single customer account with site-access, but, no product access, like the example below:
!no_access.png|thumbnail!
# Make sure that this account has access to a Service Management project so the user should be able to access the portal and view it.
# As a site-admin, go to the site's administration and access the *Product access* part.
# There, under the *What you need to know* session, tap the *Change this setting* button and select a product.
# Have the customer accessing the site via its URL (example.atlassian.net)

(i) Although the default message states that the landing product is Jira, by tapping the option to change the default product, the dropdown will prompt you to select a product:

!default.png|thumbnail!

If you have already configured a product, after tapping this option, it will look like the following, already having the product selected:

!changed.png|thumbnail!

h3. Expected Results
The user should be redirected to the portal.

h3. Actual Results
The user will face a message that they don't have access to the landing product:

{quote}
account@example.com doesn't have access to Jira/Confluence on example.atlassian.net
{quote}

h3. Workaround
The customer can directly access one of the following URLs to land on the portal:

* The portal URL.
* https://example.atlassian.net/jira (with the /jira context path added to the site's URL)
* The project URL (e.g. https://example.atlassian.net/jira/servicedesk/projects/KEY)",,Bug,Jira Service Management Cloud,Permissions & Roles - Customers,2021-03-30T15:22:36.000+0000,2021-04-29T22:55:23.000+0000,Needs Triage,Low,Giuliano C.,Giuliano C.,,,,,,,"            Author                          Created  \

It comes up without fail at least once a week, if not more. Composer users want to be able to build apps that page through large result sets (perhaps lists of assets matching a given query), and they can't do that at the moment. Their only option is to mirror the Blockchain data into an external database and build an app which queries that instead.\r\n\r\nWill leave the same comment in FAB-2809.

Hyperledger,19338,9,Peer overwrites limit/skip fields in CouchDB query string,"If I pass in a CouchDB query string that specifies either `limit` or `skip`, then the query results are not as I would expect.

It seems that the peer has some code in it that forcibly sets `limit` to a configuration value from `core.yaml`, and forcibly sets `skip` to 0. It does this without checking whether `limit` or `skip` are already specified by the user in the query string.

This is the query string that we send in:
{code:java}
{""selector"":{""$class"":""systest.queries.SampleAsset"",""$registryType"":""Asset"",""$registryId"":""systest.queries.SampleAsset""},""limit"":2}{code}
This is the output of the peer rewriting the query:

IntelDAOS,16799,21,Unable to fill a pool with enough data to cause rebuild to fail,"In an attempt to get the pool/rebuild_no_cap.py test working (create a pool with enough data such that rebuild fails due to lack of space when one server is excluded) I am unable to write enough data to the pool in order to create the situation that the test is intended to verify.

If I create one 16MB pool across 4 servers with 1 target each, I am able to write 16MB - 30MB (in 1MB increments) to the pool with IOR:

(Note the amount of free space being reported after each IOR command is increasing less with each iteration. The delta is the difference between the reported free space before running IOR and after the current IOR run.)

Writing 31MB fails with not enough space: ior ERROR (../../src/aiori-DAOS.c:431): 0: -1007: daos_array_write() failed (-1007).

Using this data, I then create the same one 16MB pool across 4 servers with 1 target each and write 30MB to the pool with IOR. Given that 31MB was too much data to write to the pool (although I believe this should be closer to 60MB) I would expect that the exclusion of 1 server would prevent rebuild from succeeding due to lack of space, however the rebuild is reported as successful (errno is 0):

I added reporting the Daos_Space.s_total and Daos_Space.s_free space usage information from the DaosPool.pool_query() and we are also wondering if these are accurate. These values are affected by the number of targets per server. Is this expected?

These values are affected by the number of targets per server. Is this expected?""\r\n\r\nThere would be some slight variance based on the number of targets because metadata is duplicated.   For instance, any target that has an object shard would have container and object trees so having more targets and more shards means more duplication of this top level tree metadata.  How much variance are you seeing?  The totals should have slightly less data.\r\n\r\nAs for your rebuild problem, are you generating all unique data or does your test case do any overwrites.   If the latter, the extra space used will only be temporary but freed by aggregation which could affect your inability to cause a rebuild problem?
