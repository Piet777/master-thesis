        "Description":"I found that the values from QRotationReading was changed when I switched from Qt 5.12.0 and NDK 18.0 to Qt 5.13.0 and android NDK 20 (SDK Version: 26.1.1, NDK Version: 20.0.5594570):\r\n* each x\/y\/z value now have values [-57.2958,57.2958]\r\n* that is equal to [-1.0, 1.0] converted from radians to degrees\r\n\r\nSo the ASensorEvent.vector (used in qtsensors\/src\/plugins\/sensors\/android\/androidrotation.cpp) values are not radians, but -1..1 values.\r\n\r\nAlso the readings are become rough after the update (~2-3 readings per second), before they was much smoother (~20-30 readings per second). And dataRate doesn't help at all...",
