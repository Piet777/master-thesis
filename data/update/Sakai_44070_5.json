        "Description":"There are many different Citation TYPES in Endnote, e.g. JOUR=Journal, PAT=Patent etc. Sakai only recognises about 6 types, BUT if the type is not recognised, then it loses a whole lot of other fields (e.g. Title, which DID exist in the imported file). \n\nAlso on Edit > Select citation type, in the dropdown list of possible types, 'other' would make more sense rather than 'unknown'. (But editing it is too late, if the citation has already been imported into WL and all the other data has been lost).\n\n\n",
